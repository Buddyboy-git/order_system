# order_system Project: Next Steps

Congratulations! Your new project structure and documentation are in place. Here’s what to do next:

## 1. Migrate Your Files
- Use `docs/migration_checklist.md` to track your progress.
- Move/copy all scripts, data, and docs into the new folders.

## 2. Sync PHP to XAMPP
- Use `docs/sync_php_to_xampp.ps1` to keep your live server up to date.
- See `docs/sync_instructions.md` for details.

## 3. Update and Test
- Update any file paths in your scripts to match the new structure.
- Test all scripts from their new locations.

## 4. Version Control
- Initialize Git (if not already done).
- Commit and push your organized project.

## 5. Clean Up
- Archive or delete old scattered files to avoid confusion.
