# order_system Project: File Inventory Template

Use this template to list all files you plan to migrate. This will help you track what’s been moved, what needs updating, and what can be archived.

| File Name / Path | Old Location | New Location | Status (To Move / Moved / Updated / Archived) | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
|                  |             |              |                                               |       |
|                  |             |              |                                               |       |
